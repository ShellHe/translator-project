Big Picture
A translator that can translate in English to Chinese and Chinese to English. It will be avaliable for both text and voice recognition. And it will be available on website and mobile app. The other user said the program is so far good, but needs more amount of words.

First Round
First be able to translate the most common terms and sentences in Chinese. Right now, there are 50 phrases available. Later, I will be improve it to 100 words. The other users can use it by typing the things they want to know how to say in Chinese or English and transilate

Test Plan for the First Ground
able to translate 50 basic phrases in both languages and if error, there is going to be a llama showing up. The user is prompted to enter an English phrase. User enters "Hello" The program prints "Nihao". Or, the user enters "Nihao", the program returns "Hello"

Relections and revisions
To make my program interesting and different from other translation programs, I put a llama when there is an error or when the words from the user is not existing in the list. However, sometimes the llama showed up even there was no error, so I change the code to if/else conditionals

Next Steps
More amount of words and more complex words. I will also add more phrases and combinations of words.
